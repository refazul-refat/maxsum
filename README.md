###Introduction

N=Total number of variables.

#####Postulates:
1. There won't be any cycle.
2. Dimension of the utility function = 2.
3. Each variable is numbered by an integer between 0 and (N-1) inclusive.


#####Corollary:
1. There will be (N-1) utility functions.
2. There will be (N-1)*2 edges. 


###Input
1. First line will be N.
2. It will be followed by (N-1) lines each containing two integers X,Y (0<=X,Y<N) to denote the existence of utility function between X and Y.
3. Then there will be (N-1) matrices denoting the corresponding utility functions.

###Output
